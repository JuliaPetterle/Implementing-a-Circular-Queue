# Implementing-a-Circular-Queue
// I did this project in my Data Structures class

Final Grade: 100%

Professor's Instructions:
Write a C program to implement a queue of at most n-1 elements using an array of size n.

1. At the beginning of your code (outside all subprograms), declare a datatype named `struct Queue`. It must be designed according to the pseudo codes (refer to Figure 2) and the provided main function. (10 points)

2. Define the subprograms to implement the build, enqueue, and dequeue operations. The meaning of enqueue and dequeue is explained in the pseudocodes in Figure 2. The pseudocodes do not include error checking for underflow and overflow. You are required to extend and implement them to prevent underflow and overflow of the queue. Your code must provide meaningful error messages whenever errors are detected or underflow, overflow, or other potential runtime error are prevented. See Figure 3 for an example (75 points)

3. Add comments to the header of each subprogram to explain their behavior in terms of how input is transformed into output. Also, explain the meaning of each line of your code (15 points)
